Hellooooooo this is my first post on this website!

`print('Hello world')`

I've very excited, although there is stll a lot of renovations to be done in order to make this website nice. 

- I have to find a good-looking and deceiving profile photo. 
- get rid of portfolio (or keep it?).
- decide whether to keep the coursework page.
- more detailed and precise description on PMLS and perhaps the QG projects.
